## 1) A fulfilling life - A comfortable country

### 1.01) A civilized citizen - An advanced human resource

#### Introduction [1.01]

Education is a cultural process that generates new knowledge by acquiring and disseminating existing knowledge. The existence and development of a civilized and responsible society hinge on the quality of its education. In Sri Lanka, the education system faces several crises. A major issue is the high dropout rate, with many students leaving school before completing at least 13 years of education. For example, in 2008, 11.3% of children who entered the first year left school before sitting for the GCE O/L examination in 2018. By 2020, only 64.7% of students who sat for the GCE O/L examination proceeded to the GCE A/L level, meaning that 35.3% of those who entered the first year did not reach the GCE A/L examination. Only 35.4% of these students passed the GCE A/L examination and merely 12.7% secured university entrance.

Another significant problem is the disparity in the distribution of human and physical resources within the school system, which has led to a breakdown in parental trust in the system. According to the 2022 school census report, out of 10,126 schools, 1,473 (14.5%) have fewer than 50 students, and 5,204 schools (51.4%) have fewer than 200 students.

This means that over half of the schools are underutilized and lack basic facilities. Only 396 schools are classified as national schools, and just 2,959 schools (29%) offer GCE A/L subject streams. The high cost of education that has to be borne by parents, despite the policy of free education from the first year to the first degree, is another major concern.

Furthermore, serious social criticism exists on the education system’s failure to produce quality citizens. While education is not solely about preparing individuals for the job market, it should equip citizens to fulfil social responsibilities and contribute positively to the national economy. The current mismatch between the education system and the needs of the main economic sectors, agriculture, industry, and service, is evident.

The NPP’s education policy aims to provide quality education that fosters a developed, humanistic, and responsible society. To achieve these goals, we will increase public investment in the education sector, gradually raising the allocation to education as a percentage of the gross domestic product up to 6%.

### 1.02) A vigorous life - Healthy people

#### Introduction [1.02]

According to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, health is a human right. The right to health is intrinsically linked to all other human rights.

Patient empowerment is one of the key elements of patient-centred healthcare. Gender inequality remains a critical challenge in the health sector. Achieving Universal Health

Coverage (UHC) is one of the world’s nations’ targets when adopting the Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs). All Sri Lankans have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. Therefore, it is the duty of the responsible government to provide the most efficient evidence-based medical care to all citizens without delay. Quality healthcare systems include patient safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity and patient-centeredness. Safety and quality systems are integrated with governance processes to enable the Ministry of Health to actively manage and improve the safety and quality of health care for patients.

The WHO’s ranking of the world’s health systems indicated that the Sri Lankan health system was 76 in the year 2000. According to the 2024 edition of the CEOWORLD magazine’s Health Care Index, Sri Lanka has been ranked as 105 globally. The WHO recommends that government expenditure on health as a % of GDP should be, at least 5%. Further, a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their expenditure on health care out of pocket now. WHO further recommends that out-of-pocket expenditure on health should be less than 20%. But a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their expenditure on health care out of pocket now. The reforms will require strengthening all aspects of the health system – financing, human resources, pharmaceuticals, and information systems – to meet the needs of a complex service delivery system.

### 1.03) A comfortable home - A healthy living

#### Introduction [1.03]

The housing issue in Sri Lanka, particularly in urban areas, has become increasingly severe, especially for low-income families. In Colombo alone, approximately 65,000 homes in low-income settlements are spread across 1,000 acres. Residents in these areas have been largely neglected by previous governments and suffer from a lack of basic amenities such as water, electricity, sanitation, and clean air. While other urban residents can build, buy, or rent homes, varying income levels make these options challenging for many. Government employees, in particular, struggle with the high cost of rent, as their incomes are often insufficient to cover these expenses.

Rural housing issues also persist, although they have received less attention from the government. Even when families own land, they face problems such as unclear land ownership, poor locations, lack of access roads, high costs of building materials, and unstable income levels, making it difficult to construct or maintain homes. Approximately 2% of Sri Lanka’s rural population lives in estate housing, primarily in the Central, Uva,

Sabaragamuwa, and Southern Provinces. Most of these estate worker communities reside in overcrowded line houses with minimal facilities. Significant social issues arise as the number of households within these communities increases. Despite having land, the low incomes of these families prevent them from building adequate homes, forcing them to live under extremely poor conditions.

Our goal is to construct multi-story housing complexes wherever possible, efficiently managing the limited land available and addressing the needs of the people.

### 1.04) An energetic citizen - Triumphant people

#### Introduction [1.04]

Sports play a crucial role not only in fostering participation and achieving victory but also in shaping a healthy, disciplined, and intelligent society. Success in sports brings honor and pride to the country, while participation promotes a healthier nation, creating individuals with discipline, strong personality, and sound mental health.

However, inefficient management and political interference have become significant barriers to the growth of the sports sector. The current disorganized system has allowed certain sports and athletes to fall under the control of private entities. Additionally, a substantial portion of resources and services are concentrated in urban areas, leaving athletes in rural and estate sectors neglected.

Despite the immense potential that sports offer to a country like Sri Lanka—one that has faced numerous challenges—the nation’s position in the international sports arena remains low. Although Sri Lankan cricket once enjoyed a prominent status, it has recently seen a decline. The NPP is committed to implementing a sports and physical well-being policy that will restore national pride and cultivate a healthy and disciplined populace.

### 1.05) A rich cultural life - A compassionate society

#### Introduction [1.05]

The cultural and artistic space is a highly sensitive area within a society. Though culture and art seem to take time to have an impact on the human community, the decline in these areas has caused a significant erosion in contemporary Sri Lankan society. The intentional destruction of the foundation of culture and arts has weakened civil society.

Several past governments have neglected the cultural sector. The educational framework, which should have been effectively developed and maintained from early childhood, has often fallen victim to shifts in political power. As a result, society’s failure to cultivate a developed cultural life has led individuals to fall short of becoming complete and empowered citizens, even after progressing through stages such as preschool, school, technical college, and university. This failure has led to a loss of faith in the belief that culture is the root of human life.

This field of culture is shaped by the interplay of interconnected domains, including education, art, media, and religious beliefs. The long-term decline of these areas has given rise to numerous social issues, such as excessive competition, restlessness, stress, suicides, dissatisfaction, violence, environmental neglect, and a diminished sense of dignity.

Society is now calling for a new vision that can swiftly address these wounds and bring about essential changes. Such a transformation can only be realized through a robust revitalization of the cultural sector, aimed at fostering a national revival. The National

People’s Power movement aspires to create a new cultural individual or cultured person —one that is free, critical, respectful of human dignity, and embraces diverse cultures.

### 1.07) A sustainable biotic world - An Avergreen life

#### Introduction [1.07]

The total land area of Sri Lanka is 65,610 square kilometers. In addition to this, it encompasses a marine zone of 18,060 square kilometres, a neighbouring marine zone of 19,620 square kilometres, and an extended economic zone of 437,400 square kilometres.

According to the topography, the area up to 300 feet is classified as the coastal zone, while areas between 300 feet to 1,000 feet and above are categorized as mountainous regions.

The annual rainfall varies from 900 millimetres to over 5,000 millimetres. The primary river systems are fed by 103 major rivers and 94 smaller rivers and streams. Due to the interconnections among environmental systems, the entire land area of Sri Lanka can be considered a single ecosystem. The fertile soil layer and plant-animal species of which, about 25% to 30% is identified endemic are unique features.

Despite this, Sri Lanka has been unsuccessful in creating an environment-friendly and economically developed society. For over 20 years, it has been unsuccessful in defining the marine zone in the environmentally important continental pool under the exclusive economic zone, which is more than 20 times larger than Sri Lanka. Despite being a signatory

Country to many of the international Conventions and Treaties and also having more than 100 environmental laws in the country, it has failed to build up an environmentally 31friendly nation. Due to the lack of proper land-use planning, the land is turning into barren land with soil erosion and landslides. The absence of proper water management has caused severe water shortages and disasters from excess water as well. Doubling evaporation rates over a short period of 30 years, the destruction of water resources, and other environmental factors directly affecting these resources are considered major issues.

The environmental policy of the NPP with the vision of “a sustainable environment that ensures the healthy existence of biodiversity” gives priority to the use of natural resources ensuring the balance between socio-economic development and the environment, a participatory approach in sustainable management, minimizing climate change impacts, and a healthy society with a balanced environment built upon knowledge, skills, attitudes and mindset.

### 1.08) Free media industry - An objectively informed society

#### Introduction [1.08]

Human communication is inherently linked and has evolved over time into a dominant social process, closely intertwined with modern technology. Mass media represents the modern state of this long-standing evolution. The term ‘media’ encompasses the technical methods, tools, institutions, technical procedures, organizational structures, and other elements used to disseminate various messages to the public. It is the means through which broad objectives such as information providing, education, persuasion, entertainment, social adaptation, cultural promotion, and mutual co-existence are achieved. The effectiveness of journalism relies on the integrity and quality of all these components.

The media process should be tailored to the specific needs of a country, society, or community. Therefore, policies and initiatives that establish its foundation are crucial.

Since gaining independence in 1948, successive governments in Sri Lanka have used print and electronic media as the mechanism to maintain their power. Consequently, instead of delivering accurate, truthful, and clear news, the media in the country has increasingly focused on promoting pro-government narratives, eulogies and personal biases. The challenge is that news and feature programs filled with deception, misrepresentation, and biased attitudes have fueled mistrust, suspicion, and conflict among ethnic groups. As journalists increasingly became political partisans more focused on profit and attention than integrity, public trust in the media began to erode.

The NPP is committed to preventing the deliberate and strategic misuse of mass media. 36By positioning mass media, journalists, and the audience as catalysts for social, political, economic, and cultural renewal, the NPP is dedicated to ensuring technical support and safeguarding the professional integrity of journalists.

#### Principles [1.08]

- 1.08.P1) The right of people to access truthful and accurate information

- 1.08.P2) A media industry that is responsible and humanistic

- 1.08.P3) Freedom and independence of the media

#### Introduction [2.01]

Approximately 5.7 million people in Sri Lanka live below the national poverty line (set at Rs. 16,326 per month as of May 2024 as confirmed by the Department of Census and

Statistics. A report published by the United Nations Development Programme indicates that more than half of the population (55.7%), which is about 12.34 million people, are exposed to multidimensional poverty. This reflects a significant challenge: since gaining independence, the political parties in power have left a social legacy where a substantial portion of the population remains poor and suffers from multidimensional vulnerabilities.

Since independence, every government elected to power has implemented various social protection and welfare programs aimed at alleviating poverty. While these programs provide financial and/or livelihood support to the needy, these programmes suffer from several inherent weaknesses, such as inefficiency, high administrative costs, lack of transparency in the selection of beneficiaries, failure to reach the intended recipients, political interference, and delays in payments etc. As a result, successive governments have failed to provide adequate and strong social protection and welfare to those in need.

The NPP views social protection and welfare as a core responsibility of the state. Given the current economic conditions where a significant portion of the population lacks employment, business opportunities, and viable economic prospects, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive social protection program to rebuild the economy and society.

The objective of the NPP’s social protection and welfare programs is to improve the living standards of those entitled to welfare benefits and to enable them to become active participants in the economy quickly. We aspire to provide “a universal social protection system based on the life cycle approach for all Sri Lankans. ”

### 2.02) An efficient workforce - A respectable professional life

#### Introduction [2.02]

Human labor is both a key factor of production and a driving force in social development.

However, in modern society, the status and importance that should be accorded to the worker have been devalued. Despite the critical role that both trained and untrained workers play in the production process, many workers find themselves in situations where they do not receive even a minimum living wage. As a result, most of the labor force faces harsh experiences in their economic, social, and cultural lives. The goal of this initiative is to establish a system where labor is respected and valued appropriately, by fostering humane employer-employee relationships that ensure equality and recognition for workers of all levels.

### 2.03) Impartial human identity - Gender equality in social-life

#### Introduction [2.03]

Although women are an integral part of society, they consistently occupy an unequal position due to marginalization within major socio-economic, cultural, and political systems. This inequality occurs across all sectors, including the home, community, workplace, and politics. In recent decades, the situation has worsened due to neoliberal economic policies. Despite women being the primary earners of foreign remittances, the necessary structural and ideological changes for equality and justice have not yet taken place. Instead, the commodification of women’s identities and their marginalization in the labor market have intensified.

Overall, factors such as the marginalization of both women and men as vulnerable workers, the direct impact on women due to the weakening of public services like education and healthcare, and the enactment of laws controlling women’s bodies amidst militarization and ethno-religious extremism highlight women’s issues as a broader social crisis.

Therefore, the current issues faced by women in Sri Lanka must be understood through an intersectional perspective. The NPP proposes a political practice that represents all marginalized groups in society, aiming to realize the aspirations of a just society, a free country, and free women by securing all rights. Hence, its policies on women are intrinsically linked to its other policies.

Gender identities and sexual orientations are diverse. However, in Sri Lanka, these groups often face violence, marginalization, and stigmatization. Additionally, outdated colonial laws, institutional frameworks, and regressive cultural beliefs contribute to the denial of justice to these communities. In a just society that treats everyone equally, no group should be marginalized because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.

#### Principles [2.03]

- 2.03.P1) Economic justice as a cornerstone for achieving gender equality.

- 2.03.P2) State policies acknowledging the value of unpaid care work within the national economy. 44■ Legislation that ensures fair and equal treatment for all marginalized groups.

### 2.04) A safer world for children - A creative future generation

#### Introduction [2.04]

By 2023, Sri Lanka’s population was 22,037,000 and 6,642,331, which is 30.14% of the total population, were children under 18 years of age, according to the definition of the United Nations. Today, children face significant issues such as weak justice systems, inadequate protection services, educational challenges, and malnutrition. The judicial process for children who fall victim to crimes often drags on for excessively long periods, sometimes extending even 6 to 10 years.

Currently, the Department of Prisons transports children to and from court alongside adult offenders, endangering their safety and privacy. Decades-old laws like the Vagrants

Ordinance, which has been in force since colonization, continue to infringe on individuals’ freedom of movement, violating the rights of children and their families. A comprehensive review of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, which has undergone only minor amendments over the decades, is also necessary.

Education is crucial in developing the skills and mindset needed for children’s success in a rapidly changing world, but Sri Lanka’s current education system is failing to meet this need. The frustrations and lack of trust in the future caused by corruption and bribery in the country have driven many young people to seek opportunities abroad.

The absence of a well-organized and adequate human and physically resourceful social service system in Sri Lanka has made child welfare a significant challenge. Although field officers are assigned to social protection and related duties, gaps in identifying and assisting at-risk children and families have weakened the services. The NPP’s policy on child protection and welfare presents a comprehensive approach to ensure the safety of children in Sri Lanka through increased budget allocations, improved health and safety measures, legal reforms, and advancement of education.

#### Principles [2.04]

- 2.04.P1) A legal system aligned with international conventions like the UNCRC (United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child) that ensures freedom and safety for children.

- 2.04.P2) Proper care and nutrition for children.

- 2.04.P3) The well-being and development of all children.

- 2.04.P4) Protection of children from abuse and all forms of violence.

### 2.05) A contented youth - Cultured, independent thinkers

#### Introduction [2.05]

In Sri Lanka, 38% of the total population, that is approximately 8.5 million individuals belong to young generation. Since the independence, youth in Sri Lanka have experienced unsatisfactory lives. Particularly over the last seven decades, the prevailing political system and culture have prevented them from effective political participation. The three major uprisings in the North and South in recent decades, during which hundreds of thousands of young people lost their lives, were driven by the unfulfilled dreams of a youth that the political establishment failed to satisfy.

Contributing factors to this discontent include limited educational opportunities, restricted access to economic participation, insufficient opportunities for youth to engage in technological and communication advancements, the inability to live as equal members of society without being subjected to external pressures, and the lack of means to live with dignity and respect. The massive youth-led people’s struggle of 2022, which arose against economic hardship is one that extended beyond mere economic demands to call for a systemic change within the country. However, the core objectives of this movement were not achieved. All this highlight that the youth has represented and still represent a marginalized and overlooked group, despite being the most capable and powerful force that could contribute to the future development of the country.

### 2.06) A respectable senior citizen- A meaningful retirement

#### Introduction [2.06]

Taking care of the elderly is a responsibility of the children and relatives within a family and is a cultural value. The elderly, who have contributed to the socio-economic development of their families and communities for most of their lives, deserve care and attention during their later years. In 2023, the population of senior citizens in Sri Lanka (those aged 60 and above) was 3.7 million, representing 17.2% of the total population.

By 2045, this percentage is projected to rise to 21%. While some policymakers view the increasing elderly population as a challenge, the NPP believes that it is a national responsibility to understand and address this situation with special attention to the well- being of the elderly.

### 2.07) An unimpaired social life - An fair and equitable approach

#### Introduction [2.07]

At some point in their lives, everyone is likely to experience difficulties functioning normally, especially as they age. When a family member is born with a disability or acquires one during childhood, adolescence, or old age, it can be a painful experience.

Therefore, it is essential to take steps to empower people with disabilities and ensure an environment where they can fully participate in society. There is a higher prevalence of people with disabilities among the lower socio-economic strata and in rural areas, where adequate facilities are often lacking. In Sri Lanka, approximately 8.7% of the total population consists of people with disabilities.

The NPP recognizes and upholds the rights of persons with disabilities to live with equal rights, such as access to education and vocational training, employment, transportation, and public services. This policy presents practical measures to guarantee those rights.

##### 2.07.A07) A modern life A wealthy nation

## 3) A modern life - A wealthy nation

### 3.01) A democratic economy - An affluent country

#### Introduction [3.01]

The quality of life and socio-cultural development of citizens of a country depends on correct economic policies adopted and actions taken. The destructive economic policies and corrupt political culture followed by the leaders of the country have left us today with a battered and crippled economy and society where human lives have been shattered in every aspect.

The total government debt, Rs. 310,779 million in 1990, increased to Rs. 28,695,950 million by 2023, pushing the entire nation into a debt trap. Between 2015 and 2019 alone, the total debt increased by Rs. 13,031,543 million, reflecting a 74% increase. Additionally, there was a staggering debt growth of 51.43% in 2022 compared to 2021. As of March 31, 2024, the total public debt has reached Rs. 28,013,560 million, which exceeded USD 100,000 million.

However, due to the misappropriation of borrowed funds and the failure to invest them in economically productive projects, the economy did not grow in corresponding to the increase in debt. The annual economic growth decreased from 5% to -0.2% between 2015 and 2019 and it was -2.3% in 2023.

Weak tax administration, inefficiency, corruption, granting tax benefits to cronies, tax avoidance, and tax evasion have led to a significant decline in government tax revenue as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By December 2023, the total tax defaults alone exceeded Rs. 1,100,000 million. The government’s stance has been to impose more taxes on people, cut essential public expenditure, and sell off public assets without considering the negative consequences of the decline in the demand for goods and services and the disposable income of people.

Despite continued rhetoric about controlling inflation, the reality is that the prices of goods and services have risen to unaffordable levels. The ultimate result is that people’s real income has gone down so low that basic human needs cannot be fulfilled. As a result of destructive politics, about 26% of the population has been dragged below the poverty line.

The external sector of the economy also continues to weaken due to the arbitrary use of foreign reserves, weak foreign exchange management, the inability to refinance foreign debt caused by the continuous downgrading of the credit rating of the country, the inability to attract foreign investment, rising import expenditure, and stagnant export earnings.

Even foreign reserves at the end of May 2024 stood at USD 5.4 billion (including USD 1.5 billion SW AP loan facilities provided by the People’s Bank of China), it was mainly an outcome of unpaid interest, debt instalments in arrears, import restrictions, remittances from overseas Sri Lankans, and receipt of IMF extended fund facility, rather than a result of proactive and sustainable measures of the government. 56Inequality in income distribution has also been widening. The bottom 20% of households receive only 4.6% of the national income, while the top 20% get 51.4% of the income.

The NPP’s economic policy framework focuses on economic democracy and is integrated with a human resource development plan and a technological development roadmap to ensure equitable opportunities in economic activities, participation in the economic decision making process with an equal say, and a fair share of economic benefits, has been developed based on ten key principles to achieve sustainable economic growth and development, aiming a Real GDP target of USD 120 billion by 2030 through a resilient production economy.

In formulating these policies, factors such as resource availability and accessibility, outcomes of research and development activities, socially embedded knowledge, civilization process, biodiversity, technology, strategic location of the country and the nature of diplomatic relations have been considered.

### 3.02) Higher productivity - Nation with food security

#### Introduction [3.02]

Currently, the agricultural sector contributes 8.4% to GDP , while employment in this sector accounts for approximately 27%. Additionally, 15.3% of export revenue is generated from agricultural crops. This highlights the significant role agriculture plays in

Sri Lankan society.

With rapid population growth, traditional technologies alone became insufficient to produce the required amount of food for the population, prompting Sri Lanka to adopt modern technological methods. These efforts enabled the country to meet the target of producing 2.4 million metric tons of rice necessary for the population. However, some shortsighted policies implemented during past administrations have challenged domestic rice production. Farmers struggle to receive a fair price for their harvests, while consumers find purchasing preferred rice varieties at affordable prices difficult.

Increasing the production of high-quality vegetables and fruits has become a challenge, with approximately 30% of the total vegetable and fruit production being lost post- harvest. Looking at the other field crop sector, the country spent about USD 400 million on imports in 2022 alone. Additionally, the production of foreign exchange-earning crops such as tea, coconut, rubber, export-oriented crops, and specialty crops has declined. The wrong agricultural policies and actions of past governments, along with the failure to adopt appropriate technologies, have contributed to these issues.

As a result, the current agriculture sector in Sri Lanka faces several major challenges, including subsistence farming, minimal mechanization, high production costs, insufficient prices for production, high prices and price volatility of agricultural products, weak extension services, inadequate value addition, and low youth participation. This agricultural policy has been formulated after carefully considering the prevailing conditions, and it is expected that its implementation will yield an income of approximately LKR 3 million per acre annually. The policy aims to exceed 400 million metric tons in national tea production, increase the yield per coconut tree to 80 coconuts per annum, raise the rubber yield to 1,300 kilograms per hectare per year, and achieve a paddy yield of 6 metric tons per hectare.

### 3.03) High-quality livestock production - An entrepreneurial approach

#### Introduction [3.03]

The livestock sector plays a vital role in providing essential proteins and other nutrients to the people of Sri Lanka. Additionally, it significantly strengthens the national economy and improves livelihoods through import substitution. The sustainability of the livestock industry depends on factors such as production capacity, the number of livestock farms, infrastructure, the labour force, and the availability of policymakers, administrators, researchers, and other stakeholders.

However, livestock production in Sri Lanka has not yet reached the desired levels, and the sector faces numerous challenges. These include severe shortages of quality animal food and breeding materials, high prevalence of animal diseases, weak supply chains and services related to production, unethical and imbalanced markets, lack of organized value chain developments and proper livestock extension programs, inadequate health services, poor management of breeding activities, minimal research interventions, limited access to credit and insurance facilities, and insufficient incentives and guidance for stakeholders.

These challenges contribute to the inefficiency within Sri Lanka’s livestock sector.

The NPP aspired to achieve sustainable development in the livestock sector through the implementation of strategic approaches and activities by efficiently managing it under favorable climate conditions.

### 3.04) A sustainable management - A quality fish resource

#### Introduction [3.04]

The need for protein has been identified as a major component in human nutrition, with fish and related products recognized as a high-quality, safe source of protein.

Therefore, it is a national priority to strengthen fisheries and aquaculture to meet the country’s demand for fish. Fisheries, aquaculture, and related industries can also contribute to sectors such as gross domestic production, food security, job creation, uplifting the socio-economic status of people, and earning foreign exchange.

The fisheries in Sri Lanka can be divided into main categories: seawater fisheries and freshwater fisheries and the aquaculture industry. The ocean region of Sri Lanka encompasses a unique economic zone of 517,000 square kilometers. It also consists of a local waterbody of 21,500 square kilometers, lagoons and estuaries covering 1,580 square kilometers, and reservoirs spanning 5,200 square kilometers. Currently, around 225,000 individuals in Sri Lanka engage in seawater fisheries, while approximately 90,650 are involved in freshwater fisheries. In the year 2000 the fisheries and related industries contributed 2.7%. to the country’s GDP . But this has now decreased to 1.2%. Our annual per capita fish consumption, which was 17.2 kilograms in 2017, has now declined to 11.07 kilograms. This trend has adversely affected the health of people, especially children and pregnant mothers.

The fisheries and aquaculture sectors are currently facing many issues. Among them, the high expenditure on fuel and other resources, the government’s lack of interventions to introduce better technology and techniques, illegal fishing activities by foreign vessels, an outdated legal framework and processes, and insufficient incentives for sustainable and eco-friendly techniques are the primary concerns. The main aims of this policy framework include the development and management of the fisheries in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner through proper scientific techniques and practical methods, thereby increasing fish products and making them available to consumers at a reasonable price, as well as uplifting the living standards of those engaged in fisheries.

#### Introduction [3.06]

Research and development (R&D) combined with science and technology produces value-added products and services, uplifting the country’s economy, and supporting human and social development. Sri Lanka allocates only the limited amount of 0.12% of its annual GDP for research and development, while countries with similar geo-political characteristics such as Malaysia allocates 1%, with Thailand 1.2% and Vietnam 0.42%.

Meanwhile South Korea allocates 4.6%, Japan 3.6%, USA 3.5%, and China 3%, becoming 75developed countries. Even the limited research conducted in Sri Lanka have not been used properly for economic and social development.

Sri Lanka possesses many resources, including endemic flora and fauna species with high biodiversity and herbal value, geological resources, the sea surrounding the island, freshwater resources within the country, balanced soil, tropical climate, year-round solar power, wind power, and rivers and lakes with much potential. All these elements can be used to produce value-added products and services with lower costs, giving higher profits, and they carry a huge potential in the international market.

Sri Lanka is rich with intelligent human resources, and many innovators are emerging even at the village level, but a mechanism to extract their ideas and innovations or to provide the necessary infrastructure occurred at a minimum level. In the future, Sri Lanka can be turned into an innovation centre by providing resources and the correct environment to harness this human potential. The state and private sector should support with a correct vision, and efficient mechanisms to bring out their new ideas through experiments and research.

### 3.07) A modernised tourist industry - An attractive destination

#### Introduction [3.07]

The tourism industry is one of the leading industries globally, bringing economic, socio- cultural, and environmental benefits to host countries. The main resources of the tourism industry can be identified in four key areas: natural, cultural, human, and capital. A well- planned tourism industry can be developed by effectively combining these resources.

Sri Lanka’s tourism industry displayed its best performance in 2018, with 2.3 million tourist arrivals, generating USD 4.3 billion in revenue and contributing 4.9% to the GDP .

Therefore, the National People’s Power (NPP) has set its goals using 2018 as a benchmark for the tourism industry. Consequently, measures will be taken to promote tourism as a priority sector, given its potential to significantly contribute to the Sri Lankan economy and its role as a major source of foreign exchange for the country.

Our vision is to position Sri Lanka as a prominent and unique destination, attracting tourists from around the world by offering unforgettable and authentic experiences while leveraging the industry for economic growth. The National People’s Power (NPP) aims to ensure sustainability and improve the standard of living for all stakeholders.

### 3.08) An entrepreneurship explosion - An organic approach

#### Introduction [3.08]

In comparison to other developing nations, Sri Lanka has not been able to reach its potential in industrial development when compared to countries like Bangladesh,

Vietnam, and South Korea who have significantly expanded their share of the global product and service market by consistently growing their gross domestic products (GDP).

In 2023, the GDPs of Bangladesh, Vietnam, and South Korea reached USD 460 billion,

USD 409 billion, and USD 1,700 billion, respectively, while Sri Lanka’s GDP was only USD 84 billion. Moreover, these countries generated export revenues of USD 59 billion, USD 384 billion, and USD 808 billion, respectively, whereas Sri Lanka’s merchandise export revenue was just USD 17.3 billion. This disparity highlights Sri Lanka’s critical challenge in goods and services production, which stems from the lack of a comprehensive plan to enhance production capabilities and the failure to leverage advanced global technologies for productive growth.

Therefore, we consider Sri Lanka must enhance local production and transition to an export-driven economy to navigate the current economic crisis successfully. This requires a comprehensive short and long-term industrial development plan that leverages the country’s strategic location, inclusive human capital, and natural resources, supported by committed political leadership. The primary objectives of this policy framework include revitalizing collapsed local industries, boosting the competitiveness of export industry sectors, promoting service industries, tapping into new global market opportunities, attracting foreign direct investment aligned with a national strategy, fostering an investment-friendly environment, and ensuring the provision of low-cost infrastructure and inputs.

### 3.09) A sustainable resource utilization - Generation of highest benefits

#### Introduction [3.09]

Sri Lanka has an abundance of mineral resources, accumulated throughout the land space of 65,610 square kilometers. The peninsular basin, which is about twenty times the land area and including the ocean region which will be nominally granted according to the UN ocean laws, is also rich in ocean minerals. Varieties of ores of minerals such as graphite, mica, apatite, lime and dolomite, mineral sand, quartz and silica sand, feldspar, serpentine, laterite, different clay types, and gems which had been created because of different geological factors are abundantly found in Sri Lanka. Many industries such as mineral sand, cement, phosphate, ceramic, glass, and roof tiles were originated from mineral resources discovered through the mineral resource expeditions in the 1980s.

Since then, minerals have been sold as raw material without any value additions, and many of these industries have either been sold out or closed by now.

Sri Lanka has been famous since ancient times as a country abundant with variety of gems. There is an immense potential to make Sri Lanka a main centre in the global gem market by capturing a considerable portion of the global gem market using the presence of individuals who possess both traditional and modern technologies about the gem industry, the availability of university-level programmes, and the unique location of Sri

Lanka. However, Sri Lanka has been able to earn only USD 250 million a year from the gem and jewelry industry. Issues such as the lack of state sponsorship to the industry, laws and regulations not being updated, corruption and bribery due to political interventions, officials not possessing enough knowledge on the field, and the absence of proper lab facilities and a systematic evaluation mechanism are main reasonings for this situation.

There is an ability to start industries that can provide a considerable support to the national economy using lime, calcite and dolomite, mineral sand and quarts, and silica which possess graphite, apatite, calcium carbonate. There are possibilities to develop industries based on value added products from ores that contain iron and copper, as well as other small mineral ores discovered so far. Moreover, mineral resources on land and seabed can be discovered and their mineral ores and rare earth elements (REE) can be used to earn foreign exchange.

### 3.10) A secured energy centre - A sustainable revenue source

#### Introduction [3.10]

The global energy field is passing a transformative era with sustainability and innovation, adjusting to constantly evolving customer needs and regulation frameworks. New energy methods such as solar power, wind power, and energy storing systems are achieving a rapid development due to the global aim of reducing greenhouse emissions and the need to reduce cost. Further, technology with low harmful emissions such as green hydrogen and small-scale nuclear power plants are coming forward. The cost of producing batteries is rapidly reducing, and the global transportation field is rapidly becoming electrified.

Total electrification of energy consumption is a method of achieving zero emission goals.

Fossil fuel continues to fulfill a considerable role in meeting global energy demands, and 91a global discourse has come up which urges the minimization of the harm it has on the environment. It is also important to maintain a strategic mixture of energy towards energy protection amidst geo-political conflicts and disagreements. In this case much attention has been directed towards natural gas as an interim step in transitioning towards renewable energy. International investments are expanding towards broadening the exploration and production of new gas resources and infrastructure for LNG.

While the trends remain such, Sri Lanka stands high up in the list of countries in the region with the highest electricity costs. It is this unbearable energy expenditure which stays a main hindrance in taking the country out of the pit of economic collapse due to decades of wrong economic management. The main factor for the electricity cost to remain high is the high cost of generation due to the strong dependency on petroleum products. A reason of this is the construction of high-cost power plants such as those which run on diesel by the former governments instead of investing in low-cost power plants in time.

Taking the energy mix towards a green economy through renewable sources, by strategically reducing its dependence on petroleum oils, will provide solutions to the basic problems. It is the aim of the National People’s Power to turn Sri Lanka’s energy system into a competitive and transparent one, empowering the customers and equipped with the latest technology. Whilst saving our environment for the future generations, the NPP hopes to consider energy as an important part of the mission to capture an appropriate portion of the world manufactured products market.

### 3.11) A good public transportation service - Speedy destination

#### Introduction [3.11]

Unsystematic and inefficient transport has wasted a considerable amount of time of most of the public. Heavy traffic, wasting a lot of time on the road, transport services not working at night, too many road accidents, and sexual and other harassment faced by women and children in public services characterises our passenger transport service. The reporting of around 30,000 road accidents a year is an indication of the lack of safety and its intensity in the transport sector. The contribution of the railway service has dropped to 5% in the transport sector. The portion of the SLTB in bus passenger service has dropped to 14%. Around 55% of the citizens opt to use private vehicles to fulfil their transport needs due to the decline in public transport, and they have to spend a large amount of their income on transport as a result. It has also resulted in high road traffic. 88,200 km of the entire 119,382 km road network of Sri Lanka belongs to local government institutes, and many roads at the rural and semi-urban areas are in a dilapidated state due to lack of maintenance. A large amount of money flows out annually to import fuel, and around 65% of the fuel burned in the country are spent in the transport sector. It thereby contributed to half of the air pollution. Further, around 35% of fruits and vegetables go into waste due to unsatisfactory transportation.

National People’s Power wishes to establish an efficient, trustworthy, safe, and dignified people-oriented transport service with the long-term vision to gradually transform it into an eco-friendly system. Hence the goal is to provide 70% of the public’s transport needs through public transportation within 5 years.

### 3.12) A sustainable marine resource - Acquiring a portion of global maritime business

#### Introduction [3.12]

Sri Lanka plays a big role in the global nautical field based on its strategic location at a centre where Eastern and Western sea routes meet. Yearly, thousands of tons of goods are transported by ships that sail past our country. The Colombo Harbour is located at an ideal spot to conduct this sea transportation, while the Hambantota Harbour, located in the South, operates much lower than its capacity. There is potential to develop the

Colombo and Hambantota ports as two of the biggest naval centres in the world by attracting a considerable portion of the global maritime industry, providing competitive services and investing in infrastructure. The main ports of Colombo, Galle, Hambantota, and Trincomalee greatly contribute to the country’s business and economic development and affect a large portion of the country’s market.

Sri Lanka’s sailors hold world fame for their excellence, skill, and performance, and they are a main resource in our nautical field. There is a considerable potential to earn foreign exchange and create job opportunities with high benefit for the country’s youth, through the development of the number of professional sailors in Sri Lanka. This proposed policy framework brings balanced access to the development of the industry and the contribution of different stakeholders, including the harbour, nautical companies, and specialists, to bring Sri Lanka to the forefront of the global nautical field. We hope to make Sri Lanka a main nautical centre in the world through the country’s location in the Indian Ocean, development of supply efficiency, and building a world-class maritime labour force.

### 3.14) A productive land management system - Integrated control plan

#### Introduction [3.14]

According to the Land Commissioner Department, 82% of Sri Lanka’s total land area, which stands at 6.6 million hectares, belongs to the government, while the remaining 18%, amounting to 1.2 million hectares, is private land. 32% of the 5.4 million hectares that belong to the state, which is 1.7 million hectares, are forests. In general, lands have been categorized as agricultural, commercial, or residential according to their usage for ease of administration and management.

The ordinances and regulations imposed during the colonial period to control land resources have made a significant impact on land management in Sri Lanka. The governments after the independence did not make any special effort to scientifically amend these laws for the well-being of the country and its people. Instead, some land reforms and policies aimed at land distribution, driven by narrow intentions, have contributed to socio-economic inequality. Issues related to land ownership have remained unresolved for a long time, leading to various social disparities.

### 3.15) Scientifically managed construction Industry - Excellent quality workforce

#### Introduction [3.15]

The development and sustenance of the construction industry, which reflects the country’s economic development, depend on state and private investment in infrastructure and projects. Before the 2022 downfall, the construction industry contributed 7% to the country’s GDP and provided direct and indirect employment to over 1 million individuals. Despite the recent crisis, the industry has the potential for significant growth with the right investments and strategies.

Currently, most of the constructors and advisors in the field are from the private sector, and the construction companies owned by the government show less performance due to interventions and inefficient control.

Shortcomings in the procurement process, inefficiency, weak project management practices, political interventions, corruption, and the implementation of projects without proper financial support pose considerable challenges to the industry’s stability. These issues hinder the performance of the construction projects, resulting in delays, excessive costs, and low-quality products. Further, outdated planning methods and standards, the inability to use new project management methods, and the lack of trained professionals negatively affect the industry. Job security and worker welfare in this field are not favourable.

Due to a lack of low-cost raw materials, new technological innovations, and limited investments in research and development, the industry has achieved only a tiny portion in the international arena. Further, brain drain has affected the industry’s lack of trained labour, daily operations, and development.

Past governments invested loans from local banks and two-party and multi-party loans in construction projects, and the lack of benefits from these projects contributed greatly to the country’s loan crisis.

### 4.02) An efficient public service - A skill based professionalism

#### Introduction [4.02]

Sri Lanka’s public service is the main instrument that implements state policies. The

Sri Lankan government service, which consists of a 1.4 million workforce, consists of different professionals and officers from ministry secretaries to office support staff, and the state spends a considerable portion of its income on maintaining it. Even though it consists of officers with different educational and professional levels possessing other skills, at present, the government service has become inefficient, failing to fulfil public expectations and losing public faith.

The inefficiency of public service and the associated bribery, corruption, fraud, and misappropriation of public property are the inevitable results of the ruling class and the system. They are not tragedies brought by public servants on their own accord. The government service has faced grave dilapidation as a result of factors such as political appointments, manipulation of state workers for disastrous political decisions, and the employment of officers for the large-scale fraud and corruption of rulers, and this has been the basis of the public’s loss of faith in the government service.

It is our aim to convert the government service to a satisfactory state instrument by freeing it from its current state and transforming it into a non-corrupted one which has the public faith and fulfils the public expectations.

### 4.03) Rule of law - A judicial system with equal access

#### Introduction [4.03]

Independent and efficient administration of justice and public confidence in the process is crucial in establishing the rule of law.

### 4.04) Public security assuring - People friendly service

#### Introduction [4.04]

Police plays a very important role in maintaining law and order in the country as an institution close to the public. An important factor that reflects how the rule of law functions is the independent and efficient functioning of the police. However, at present, the public believes that the Sri Lanka Police is an institution from which it is impossible to get any service without political or other social connections or bribery. On the other hand, some police officers are also victims of political interference and are constantly suffering due to ill-treatment. The National People’s Power expects to make the police service an independent, efficient, and friendly service that is closer to the public.

### 4.05) A humanitarian prison - A lawful confinement

#### Introduction [4.05]

The vision of the Prisons Department in Sri Lanka is to social reintegration of inmates as good citizens through rehabilitation. But in the recent past, incidents of killing and inhumane torture of prisoners in various prisons show that people who are imprisoned face different forms of abuse. Also, there is a public opinion that powerful prisoners with certain political connections enjoy special privileges. “Prisoners are also human” is only limited to a theme at present, and overcrowding and lack of basic facilities for prisoners are serious problems faced by prisons. The prison has become a place to punish prisoners rather than to reform them. Prisons at present have become criminal centres due to drug trafficking and underworld activities and have hindered the people who are serving their prison life with good behaviour.

The increase in the remand prisoner population is a major cause of prison overcrowding due to the long time it takes to complete legal proceedings. In 2022, there were 108,250 remand prisoners, 30,331 convicted prisoners, and a total of 138,581 prisoners living in prisons. Men show a higher tendency to be imprisoned than women, and the percentage of women among the total number of prisoners in 2022 was 3.23%. 19,094 or 62.95% of convicted prisoners were convicted of drug related charges. Further, 92% of the convicted prisoners had been educated up to G.E.C. O/L exam or less, while 62% were under 40.

Although it is the expectation of the National People’s Power to create a social environment where people are not inclined to do crimes, we consider the welfare of the people serving prison sentences for any reason to be the responsibility of the government.

### 4.06) A drug-free country - A healthier citizen life

#### Introduction [4.06]

At present, drug use has become a social problem due to its rapid rise. Drug use has caused many serious problems in the family as well as in society. The tendency of schoolchildren to get addicted to drugs has increased.

The current regime has failed to control the importation and distribution of drugs into the country, and jailing drug users alone is not adequate to curbing this menace. Currently, drug use has created a social tragedy and in 2022, 152,979 people were arrested for drug offences. However, only 1930 people among these were referred to rehabilitation programmes. About 60% of the offenders who go to prison are in prison for drug- related offences. Sri Lanka has become a hub for drug trafficking in the region, under the protection of political and other forces, which has contributed to the growth of organized crime. Therefore, the National People’s Power prioritizes drug prevention.

Activities • An integrated operation to prevent drugs and organized crime in the country • Establishment of a separate Bureau for Narcotics Prevention • Development of naval and air surveillance facilities and provide modern equipment and training to officials to prevent the entry of drugs into the country 116• Regularize rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts to free them from drug use • Strengthening penalties for drug offences and taking measures for the speedy resolution of cases • Implementation of continuous programmes to educate school children • Expanding the functions of the Dangerous Drugs Control Board, and establishing monitoring committees to involve people in the fight against drugs • Educating the community about the adverse effects of drug use

### 4.07) A dignified diplomacy - A sovereign state

#### Introduction [4.07]

Sri Lanka’s strategic location at the center of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal has deep rooted historical antecedents. Archeological evidence provides ample materials to establish that Sri Lanka has had vibrant trade relations across the Bay of Bengal and with Southeast Asia. Sri Lanka’s geostrategic location within the Indian Ocean is a blessing as the island is astride one of the world’s busiest sea lanes of communication that connect

East and West.

Developing Asia will be the world’s largest region in terms of population. The region’s share of world GDP will reach 30.5%, and Asia will essentially be a middle-income region by 2025. Sri Lanka has a history of leadership in foreign policy, grounded in the principle of non-alignment.

For the mutual growth along with the other countries of the region as well as for the

National Security Foreign Policy play a crucial role. Factors that influence any State’s foreign policy choices are geographical location, population, history, economic resources, ideology, government efficiency, quality of diplomacy, crisis and immediate events, technological advancements, international law and institutions, etc. However, we have observed in the recent past that the determinant of the foreign policy in Sri Lanka has mainly influenced by external factors and survival choices of ruling parties rather than the best interest of Sri Lankans. National interests should be the cornerstone of the foreign policy. Foreign policy reflects national interests and offers a perspective on human and global interests of a particular State.

When the current situation of Sri Lanka is considered, we are passing a period of worst economic crisis. One of the most important national interests of ours is to gradually withdraw from the debt crisis. Further domestic policy is formulated to protect and promote the national interest domestically within the country. A country’s foreign policy is designed based on national strategy to protect and promote the national interests.

Foreign and domestic policies are intertwined more closely than ever before. Sri Lanka’s current foreign relations are influenced significantly by attempts to recover from the worst economic crisis in 2022 and stands as a challenge we should overcome. Rising geopolitical tension among international and regional powers in our region has become a key challenge to Sri Lanka’s security and regional stability.

### 4.08) High level of national security - Secured state

#### Introduction [4.08]

National security is the mechanism of facing dealing with any challenges that may be posed externally or internally for the security of the citizen, the territorial integrity, and sovereignty of the country, or by natural and human activities while managing such challenges through geopolitical and geostrategic means from the security measures provided by the defence forces.

Independent and balanced diplomacy, democratic governance that respects human rights, equality and harmony that embraces diversity, and a professional military dedicated to the protection of the citizens and the state are essential factors to ensure national security.

Law enforcement agencies such as the Armed Forces, Police, Coast Guard, Excise

Department, Prisons Department and Customs, as well as intelligence services and civil defence services, play an important role in ensuring the internal security of the state. The strength and transparency of these security forces are reflected and maintained through transparent democratic governance capable of fulfilling the national power and the promotion of national interests, i.e. national inspirations. Political leadership, economic, geographical, and environmental presence, popular ideology, and defense forces can be identified as the components of national power. Non-aligned and balanced diplomatic policies, strategic foreign policies based on the understanding of global and regional geopolitical and balance security posture, as well as economic independence are the factors that affect the reduction of threats to national security globally and regionally.

### 4.09) A Sri Lankan nation - The universal citizen

#### Introduction [4.09]

Sri Lanka is a country with people of various ethnicities such as Sinhalese, Tamil,

Muslim, Burgher, Malay and various religions such as Buddhist, Hindu, Islam,

Christian, Catholic, etc. Because of that diversity, it is essential for the well-being and national unity of the country to live in a multicultural society that exists by nature, accepting and respecting each other. But the country has failed to build the Sri Lankan nation by taking advantage of the various opportunities in history. The country had to face a tragic war of 30 years as a result of creating mutual suspicion and mistrust and disunity between ethnicities and military groups for the sake of obtaining and maintaining power and narrow opportunistic political interests. The sorrows and sad results of that war still remain in Sri Lankan society. The National People’s Power is dedicated to creating national 127unity for the building of the Sri Lankan nation, not divided based on ethnicity, language, religion, caste, or gender, and by respecting the diversity of identities and ensuring their survival and protection.
